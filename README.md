Etudes completed from the book of Charles Wetherell "Etudes for Programmers"

Completed: none
Partially done: Game of Life

TODO Game of Life:
- redesign and rebuild with up-to-date practicies (use Bastnt's GoL as example);
- complete additional tasks, such as:
-   'Gardens of Eden'
-   colourful colonies
-   optimize - more sophisticated algorithms(Hashlife)/data structures
-   optimize - instead of memoizing, use algorithm to determine whether colony will change
